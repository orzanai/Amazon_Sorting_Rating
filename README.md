# Amazon Product Rating and Sorting

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the accurate calculation of post-sale ratings given to products. Solving this problem means providing more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce website, highlighting the product for sellers, and providing a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Another problem that arises is the accurate sorting of comments given to products. Misleading comments can directly affect the sale of the product, resulting in both financial loss and loss of customers. By solving these two fundamental problems, e-commerce sites and sellers can increase their sales, while customers can complete their purchasing journey smoothly.
